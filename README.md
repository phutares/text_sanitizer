# TEXT SANITIZER

## Explaining code

### CLI args "source" & "target"
Able to use CLI with arguments 
template : python3 | python file | source | target
example : python3 text_sanitizer.py example.txt target_file.txt
And also support with config file, but it will verify the existence of args first.

### Read a text file from "source" as an input data
Follows to the InitialOne class to read source file and db file.
However, able to use with config.ini file also.

### Sanitizer the input
Follows to the Sanitizer class to pass the argument of string from previous value.
Use regexp to replace the text as required.

### Generate calculator
Follows to the Calculator class to create frequency of alphabet by collection lib.

### Print & Keep output
Just print to the terminal and keep the result of terminal result to the text file for text output handling.

## Stunning
Have more steps to ... blah blah. I'm so curious in this requirement. HOW? just logical?
